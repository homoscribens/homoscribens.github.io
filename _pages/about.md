I am a master's student, studying Natural Language Processing at [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/index.html) in [Shirai Lab](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/nlp/lab/index.php?Top) advised by Professor Kiyoaki Shirai.

My research interests are in NLP systems that are reasonable, understandable and trustworthy. For that reason, I tackle tasks such as reasoning and explainability.
I am interested in Meta-cognition (e.g. awareness of ignorance) in Language Models, too.
